## Salut, je m'appelle Teuze :wave:

I'm a French-American computer science engineer living in the Paris area.<br>
I majored in cybersecurity, but nowadays I actually prefer **system design**, **software engineering**, and **data science**.

I also like drawing, photography, animation, 3d modeling,
running, hiking, swimming, skateboard, yo-yo,
video games, travelling abroad, and reading.

I dislike unsollicited distractions, loud environments, and conflict.

I am curious, honest, playful, willing, timid, awkward, and obsessive.

Bienvenue sur mon blog :partying_face:
