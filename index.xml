      <description>#About
Hi ! I&amp;rsquo;m Richard.
I was born in October 24th, 1995, in the French city of Grenoble.  As long as I can remember, computers have been a part of my life.
First seeing them as entertaining devices, I soon started to disect them, and trying to understand how every part interacts with the others in a hands-on, hardware point of view. It led me to the discovery of open hardware and open source software, and motivated my first (unfinished) project : a semi-autonomous hexapod build over the SSC-32 servo board and a Raspberry Pi.</description>
