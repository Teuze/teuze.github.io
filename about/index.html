Hi ! I'm Richard.

I was born in October 24th, 1995, in the French city of Grenoble. </br>
As long as I can remember, computers have been a part of my life.

First seeing them as entertaining devices, I soon started to disect them, and trying to understand how every part interacts with the others in a hands-on, hardware point of view. It led me to the discovery of open hardware and open source software, and motivated my first (unfinished) project : a semi-autonomous hexapod build over the SSC-32 servo board and a Raspberry Pi. This project helped me a lot in getting a basic understanding of how an operating system works.

Around that time, I got accepted in my local engineering school, Grenoble INP Esisar, and enrolled in the cybersecurity club, the kr[HACK]en. I started solving challenges on platforms such as Root-Me and HackTheBox, getting involved in CTFs, and attending conferences like INS'Hack, GreHack and LeHack (still called Nuit du Hack at that time). </br> I even helped (twice!) organizing CSAW Europe as the Applied Research manager.

I am now a junior Security Engineer in Hacknowledge, all while being in my last year of engineering degree in a cybersecurity joint program with Grenoble INP Ensimag. So far I have studied operating systems, C and Java programming, software engineering, LAN and intra-AS networking, and cryptography. I am self-taught in threat modelling, offensive security, Python and shell scripting, and I hope to take some time soon to get certified (OSCP and CSSP would be nice!).
